I have worked during these three years at the Nuclear Physics Department of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission.</p>

<p>My thesis was divided into two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>one focusing on the study of the inelastic excitation of <sup>102</sup>Sn, <sup>100</sup>Cd and <sup>98</sup>Pd,</li>
  <li>the other one focusing on the study of the neutron-neutron correlations in <sup>11,13</sup>Li.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are experimental works where I had to analyze large volumes of heterogeneous data. The results of these studies are exposed in the manuscript of my PhD thesis, available <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2022UPASP109">here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have done my PhD between October 2019 and October 2022.

The pedagogical aim of this project was to work independently and build specialized knowledge around one topic of physics, which was theoretical nuclear structure in my case.</p>

<p>The objective of this work was to build an effective Hamiltonian representing the interactions at stake in the atomic nucleus. This has been done by extending such an operator proposed in 1970 by K. Kumar and B. Sørensen in 1970 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0375947470910821">[Nucl. Phys. A146 (1970) 1]</a>.</p>
