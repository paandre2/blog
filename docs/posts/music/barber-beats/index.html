    <p>    <em>Picture this. You are about eleven or twelve years old. You wander in the aisles of a big supermarket, located at the bottom of a gigantic mall, on a saturday morning. Your mother is next to you, pushing the cart. Your father is at the front desk of the aforementioned supermarket, trying to return a set of undersized bed sheets bought last week. As the multitude of products goes by in front of your eyes, you get lost in your thoughts, and cling to the hope that your family will have lunch at the mall’s cafeteria. All this time, the faint, echoed music of the supermarket is sprinkled over each and everything, making up the soundtrack of your saturday’s daydream.</em></p>

<p>     A decade ago, I started realizing that the internet was a great source of music from times and places that were totally distant from me. The recommendation algorithms got better and better at providing me with hidden gems. One day, I stumbled upon this cryptic album cover, with inscriptions written with Japanese kanjis. An expression was written twice using the Latin alphabet, and it said: “HAIRCUTS FOR MEN”.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/assets/img/haircuts_for_men.jpg" alt="HFM cover" style="height: 300px; width:300px;" class="center" /></p>

<p>     Intrigued, I decided to listen to it. I was welcomed by some thick, distorted lounge music. I thought that I had just discovered a Japanese artist, straight out of the 1990s, with a funny name, who would provide me with some nice easy-listening tracks for studying or cooking. But I encountered Haircuts For Men (HFM) again few months later, on an even more cryptic cover, covered in cyrillic symbols this time. This led me to think that there was more to it than I thought.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/assets/img/haircuts_for_men_2.jpg" alt="Another HFM cover" style="height: 300px; width:300px;" class="center" /></p>

<p>    One noticeable thing about HFM is that their music is hardly present on any famous streaming platform, for a simple reason: almost none of their music is composed. The tracks are only remixes of existing lounge music tracks. These are usually slowed down, lowered in pitch, and a slight reverb and saturation are applied on them. Due to laws regarding copyrights, most of HFM’s work cannot be put on traditional music streaming platforms. Where is then the point in proposing music for which the melodies, the arrangements and the chord progressions are not original? In my opinion, the answer lies in what is around HFM’s music.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/assets/img/haircuts_for_men_3.jpg" alt="Another HFM cover" style="height: 300px; width:300px;" class="center" /></p>

<p>    What strikes first is the visuals for each of HFM’s projects. They combine images of unknown sources, representing semi-abstract shapes, often next to images of ancient Greek statues and non-Roman letters. Then, HFM’s username on Twitter is simply “@user080613”. Their bandcamp page proposes digital copies of their music for free, as well as vinyl and tape recordings of their catalog. For instance, the first album mentioned in this article is proposed, and the touch of spray paint is applied on the cover by the maestro themself. The customer cannot choose the color of the spray, it is chosen at random. Some “imperfect” versions are also proposed, for which the paint is not up to HFM’s standards.</p>

<p>    All these elements reinforce the slight feeling of unease going around HFM’s music. There is nothing wrong with their music, but something is definitely slightly wrong. It feels that, somehow, we should not have this music, this work, in our hands. It looks like it belongs to another time, to another place. It looks like, due to some malfunction of reality, this music from parallel dimensions has reached our ears.</p>

<p>    Lately, an internet legend has emerged. People online state that they have left (or “noclipped” out of) our dimension, and have arrived in what is referred to as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms"><em>Backroom</em></a>, a place out of our reality, unsettling by its emptiness, not really hostile, not really welcoming. It is usually symbolized by vast open office spaces, or by abandoned shopping malls.</p>

<p>    All in HFM’s music relates to this last statement: not really hostile, not really welcoming, out of our reality. When looking for more detail about HFM, one can never be sure to have found a reliable source of information about them. Is it their Twitter account, or one of the many robots present on social media, or even a bug from the website, showing us unlisted users?  A very personal theory is that this nickname, <em>Haircuts For Men</em>, was chosen with that concealment purpose, as a simple Google search does not yield music but … pictures of haircuts for men.</p>

<p>    In the end, the work of HFM’s is here to make us feel things, rather than listen to things. It is designed to be the hidden, forgotten soundtrack of memories you never had, or memories you never thought you had, distorted and damaged by the passage of time. HFM’s music brings back that time you wandered in your high school around 7pm, when it is empty of all its students, or these saturdays when you mindlessly wandered in a huge supermarket, waiting for lunch. HFM has “an artistic style that seeks to capture a feeling or experience rather than to achieve accurate depiction”, which is the definition of impressionism according to Oxford Languages. Impressionism with a zest of modernity, as HFM uses a palette of techniques that are specific to the XXI<sup>st</sup> century and the digital world, to express feelings and emotions that are specific to the XXI<sup>st</sup> century and the digital world.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/assets/img/macroblank.png" alt="Macroblank cover" style="height: 300px; width:300px;" class="center" /></p>

<p>    HFM has had such an impact on the indie electronic wavy scene of the past years, that a whole subgenre has been named after them: Barber Beats. Other artists have joined the movement such as Macroblank (see picture above), or Monodrone (see picture below).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/blog/assets/img/monodrone.jpeg" alt="Macroblank cover" style="height: 300px; width:300px;" class="center" /></p>

<p>    This, to me, represents quite well some of the wonders of the internet. A person, somewhere on Earth, decided to depict modern feelings and concerns in an original way, without knowing that these would be relatable and shared by hundreds of thousands of anonymous people around the globe. From now on, I am very careful about the music I hear at the supermarket, and I hope your trips to buy groceries will also look a bit different. ;-)</p>
