I have done my PhD between October 2019 and October 2022. I have worked during these three years at the Nuclear Physics Department of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission.

My thesis was divided into two parts: 
- one focusing on the study of the inelastic excitation of <sup>102</sup>Sn, <sup>100</sup>Cd and <sup>98</sup>Pd,
- the other one focusing on the study of the neutron-neutron correlations in <sup>11,13</sup>Li.

Both are experimental works where I had to analyze large volumes of heterogeneous data. The results of these studies are exposed in the manuscript of my PhD thesis, available [here](https://www.theses.fr/2022UPASP109).
