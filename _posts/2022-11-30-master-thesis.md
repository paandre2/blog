I have done my master's thesis between January and June 2019 in the Mathematical Physics Department of Lund University, under the supervision of Dr. Gillis Carlsson and Dr. Andrea Idini. The pedagogical aim of this project was to work independently and build specialized knowledge around one topic of physics, which was theoretical nuclear structure in my case.

The objective of this work was to build an effective Hamiltonian representing the interactions at stake in the atomic nucleus. This has been done by extending such an operator proposed in 1970 by K. Kumar and B. SÃ¸rensen in 1970 [[Nucl. Phys. A146 (1970) 1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0375947470910821).

The manuscript I have written as a result of this study can be found [here](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/8986100).
