Here is a short summary of my CV and my experiences so far.

## *2019-2022:* PhD in experimental nuclear physics
I have studied for my PhD in the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in Saclay, France. I have worked on the topic of spectroscopy of exotic nuclei at the Nuclear Physics department of the <span style="color: #ffb66c">**Institute of Research into the Fundamental laws of the Universe (IRFU)**</span>. More details about the work I defended the 21st of October 2022 can be found [here](/research). 

## *2017-2019:* Master's degree in Engineering Physics in Sweden
I studied for a master's degree in Engineering Physics at <span style="color: #ffb66c">**Lunds Tekniska Högskola (LTH)**</span>, the Faculty of Engineering of Lund University, Lund, Sweden. I specialized in Theoretical Physics and took classes in quantum physics, nuclear physics and theory of nuclear structure. I made my master's internship in the Mathematical Physics department, and more information can be found [here](/research). 

## *2015-2017:* Engineering Degree in France
As the outcome of the competitive exams for French engineering schools, I entered <span style="color: #ffb66c">**École Centrale de Lille**</span>, Lille, France, where I spent two years studying in general engineering. The curriculum proposed there provides a training in all major fields of engineering, such materials science, programming, mechanics, electronics, or aerodynamics. I decided to take additional elective courses in thermodynamics. 

Instead of spending my last year in Lille, I enroled in a double-degree program with Lunds Tekniska Högskola (LTH), the Faculty of Engineering of Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

## *2013-2015:* French Higher School Preparatory Classes
After high school, I joined [Higher School Preparatory Classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles), in the lycée Franklin Roosevelt, Reims, France. During this training that is very specific to France, I learnt the fundamentals of mathematics, physics and chemistry.
